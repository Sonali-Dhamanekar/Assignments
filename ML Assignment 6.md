1. In the sense of machine learning, what is a model? What is the best way to train a model?

A machine learning model is an object (stored locally in a file) that has been trained to recognize certain types of patterns.

Steps to train a model:

1) Gathering and Preparing Data

2) Choosing the Right Algorithm

3) Splitting Data for Training and Evaluation

4) Training the Model/ Hyperparameter Tuning

5) Evaluating Model Performance


2. In the sense of machine learning, explain the "No Free Lunch" theorem.

The free lunch theorem in the context of machine learning states that it is not possible from available data to make predictions about the future that are better than random guessing. Data by itself only tells us the past and one cannot deduce the future from it

Theoretical Example
If we have dataset 1 that we used to train and design our model 1. We can reach an optimal solution for our problem. But if we use the same model, only changing to dataset 2, we probably won’t have a satisfactory result.

The same goes for the model that was developed for dataset 2. We don’t expect it to perform well on dataset 1

This simple yet meaningful statement relies on another reinterpretation of the NFLT given by the same authors that first postulated it.  Two different optimization solutions will have the same average performance if we take all possible problems.

This extends to the approaches we can implement. We can’t state that the decision trees are always better than the K-nearest neighbor algorithm.

As a first step, we should search for previous works and applications that might be similar to ours. Then, we should empirically try different learning algorithms based on our findings.

After correctly choosing the algorithm and conducting some fine-tuning, we’ll most likely be on the way to a satisfactory model.

3. Describe the K-fold cross-validation mechanism in detail.

K-Fold Cross Validation
In K-Fold Cross Validation, we split the dataset into k number of subsets (known as folds) then we perform training on the all the subsets but leave one(k-1) subset for the evaluation of the trained model.In this method, we iterate k times with a different subset reserved for testing purpose each time.

Advantages of train/test split:
This runs K times faster than Leave One Out cross-validation because K-fold cross-validation repeats the train/test split K-times.
Simpler to examine the detailed results of the testing process.
Advantages of cross-validation:

More accurate estimate of out-of-sample accuracy.
More “efficient” use of data as every observation is used for both training and testing.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Cross Validation

Advantages:
Overcoming Overfitting: Cross validation helps to prevent overfitting by providing a more robust estimate of the model’s performance on unseen data.
Model Selection: Cross validation can be used to compare different models and select the one that performs the best on average.
Hyperparameter tuning: Cross validation can be used to optimize the hyperparameters of a model, such as the regularization parameter, by selecting the values that result in the best performance on the validation set.
Data Efficient: Cross validation allows the use of all the available data for both training and validation, making it a more data-efficient method compared to traditional validation techniques.

Disadvantages:
Computationally Expensive: Cross validation can be computationally expensive, especially when the number of folds is large or when the model is complex and requires a long time to train.
Time-Consuming: Cross validation can be time-consuming, especially when there are many hyperparameters to tune or when multiple models need to be compared.
Bias-Variance Tradeoff: The choice of the number of folds in cross validation can impact the bias-variance tradeoff, i.e., too few folds may result in high variance, while too many folds may result in high bias.

4. Describe the bootstrap sampling method. What is the aim of it?

Bootstrapping is a resampling technique that helps in estimating the uncertainty of a statistical model.

It includes sampling the original dataset with replacement and generating multiple new datasets of the same size as the original.

Each of these new datasets is then used to calculate the desired statistic, such as the mean or standard deviation.

This process is repeated multiple times, and the resulting values are used to construct a probability distribution for the desired statistic.

This technique is often used in machine learning to estimate the accuracy of a model, validate its performance, and identify areas that need improvement.

For example, we can use bootstrap sampling to calculate the population means

5. What is the significance of calculating the Kappa value for a classification model? Demonstrate how to measure the Kappa value of a classification model using a sample collection of results.

The kappa statistic is frequently used to test interrater reliability. The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured.

The kappa statistic, which takes into account chance agreement, is defined as: (observed agreement – expected agreement)/(1 – expected agreement). When two measurements agree only at the chance level, the value of kappa is zero. When the two measurements agree perfectly, the value of kappa is 1.0.

6. Describe the model ensemble method. In machine learning, what part does it play?

Ensemble modeling is a process where multiple diverse models are created to predict an outcome, either by using many different modeling algorithms or using different training data sets. The ensemble model then aggregates the prediction of each base model and results in once final prediction for the unseen data.

You can employ ensemble learning techniques when you want to improve the performance of machine learning models. For example to increase the accuracy of classification models or to reduce the mean absolute error for regression models. Ensembling also results in a more stable model.

Ensemble methods are techniques that create multiple models and then combine them to produce improved results. Ensemble methods in machine learning usually produce more accurate solutions than a single model would.

7. What is a descriptive model's main purpose? Give examples of real-world problems that descriptive models were used to solve.

A descriptive model describes a system or other entity and its relationship to its environment. It is generally used to help specify and/or understand what the system is, what it does, and how it does it. A geometric model or spatial model is a descriptive model that represents geometric and/or spatial relationships.

Examples:

1. Traffic and Engagement Reports
One example of descriptive analytics is reporting. If your organization tracks engagement in the form of social media analytics or web traffic, you’re already using descriptive analytics.

These reports are created by taking raw data—generated when users interact with your website, advertisements, or social media content—and using it to compare current metrics to historical metrics and visualize trends.

For example, you may be responsible for reporting on which media channels drive the most traffic to the product page of your company’s website. Using descriptive analytics, you can analyze the page’s traffic data to determine the number of users from each source. You may decide to take it one step further and compare traffic source data to historical data from the same sources. This can enable you to update your team on movement; for instance, highlighting that traffic from paid advertisements increased 20 percent year over year.

The three other analytics types can then be used to determine why traffic from each source increased or decreased over time, if trends are predicted to continue, and what your team’s best course of action is moving forward.

2. Financial Statement Analysis
Another example of descriptive analytics that may be familiar to you is financial statement analysis. Financial statements are periodic reports that detail financial information about a business and, together, give a holistic view of a company’s financial health.

There are several types of financial statements, including the balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and statement of shareholders’ equity. Each caters to a specific audience and conveys different information about a company’s finances.

Financial statement analysis can be done in three primary ways: vertical, horizontal, and ratio.

Vertical analysis involves reading a statement from top to bottom and comparing each item to those above and below it. This helps determine relationships between variables. For instance, if each line item is a percentage of the total, comparing them can provide insight into which are taking up larger and smaller percentages of the whole.

Horizontal analysis involves reading a statement from left to right and comparing each item to itself from a previous period. This type of analysis determines change over time.

Finally, ratio analysis involves comparing one section of a report to another based on their relationships to the whole. This directly compares items across periods, as well as your company’s ratios to the industry’s to gauge whether yours is over- or underperforming.

Each of these financial statement analysis methods are examples of descriptive analytics, as they provide information about trends and relationships between variables based on current and historical data.



8. Describe how to evaluate a linear regression model.

Methods to evaluate:

1. R Square/Adjusted R Square

2. Mean Square Error(MSE)/Root Mean Square Error(RMSE)

3. Mean Absolute Error(MAE)

4. illustrate Residual of model as a normal distribution ( bell shape)

5. By OLS from statemodels.formula

R Square/Adjusted R Square :

This is a first measure of regression model especially we, everybody, do during evaluation because it is easy to interpret score between 0 to 1. If we see good score like close to 1, then we assume that model is good fit. Of course , R Square is a good measure to determine how well the model fits the dependent variables. However, it does not take into consideration of overfitting problem. If your regression model has many independent variables, because the model is too complicated, it may fit very well to the training data but performs badly for testing data.So I recommend that we have to see all perspective for better evaluation . let’s talk what is actually mean R² . R² is calculated by the sum of squared of prediction error divided by the total sum of square which replace the calculated prediction with mean. R Square value is between 0 to 1 and bigger value indicates a better fit between prediction and actual value.

Mean Square Error(MSE)/Root Mean Square Error(RMSE):

while R² is a relative measure of how well the model fit dependent variables, whereas Mean Square Error is an absolute measure of the fit of model. MSE is calculated by sum of square of prediction error. Where prediction error is minus between true values and prediction values, and then it is made by square because we avoid negative error score. It’s result gives us how much deviation from actual number. It’s number might be larger number which may be like uncommon . you might be question how is error score is too big .

Mean Absolute Error(MAE):

This is almost same to Mean Square Error metric but only MAE take absolute error value instead of square of predicted error for avoiding negative score . However, here , we don’t need to calculate Root of MAE score . We can interpret directly the score with real values.

Explore Residual :

At last for evaluation , We can also explore residuals, which comes from true values and predicted values, by scatterplot or diskplot of searbearn library or matplotlib. If we get linear shape on scatter plot or bell shape in distplot , then we can pretty say that model fit perfectly, and can predict very close to real values.

OLS from statemodels.formula:

By statemodels library , we can explore all over summary on one place like R² , R² adjust , coeff etc…

9. Distinguish :

1. Descriptive vs. predictive models

2. Underfitting vs. overfitting the model

3. Bootstrapping vs. cross-validation

1. Descriptive vs. predictive models

The main differences between descriptive and predictive data mining are:
Purpose: Descriptive data mining is used to describe the data and identify patterns and relationships. Predictive data mining is used to make predictions about future events.

Approach: Descriptive data mining involves analyzing historical data to identify patterns and relationships. Predictive data mining involves using statistical models and machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and relationships that can be used to make predictions.

Output: Descriptive data mining produces summaries and visualizations of the data. Predictive data mining produces models that can be used to make predictions.

Timeframe: Descriptive data mining is focused on analyzing historical data. Predictive data mining is focused on making predictions about future events.

Applications: Descriptive data mining is used in applications such as market segmentation, customer profiling, and product recommendation. Predictive data mining is used in applications such as fraud detection, risk assessment, and demand forecasting.

2. Underfitting vs. overfitting the model

Underfitting:

Model is not complex.

Model is not accurate for training set and validation set.

Need to increase complexity.

Increase number of feature

Reduce regularization.

Overfitting:

Model is too complex.

aAccurate for training

Not accurate for validation set.

Need to reduce complexity.

Apply regularization.

3. Bootstrapping vs. cross-validation

Bootstrapping and Cross Validation are not the same. Bootstrapping is a technique to train decision tree based classifiers, while Cross Validation is a method to test whether the classifier has been trained well.

Cross Validation creates multiple possible divisions of “entire dataset” into train set and corresponding validation set, and tests whether the model is not just good for one train-test split. (avoiding procedure many kagglers jokingly call “overfitting the test set”).

Bootstrapping is OTOH training m different classifiers on m different divisions of “train set” on which one classifier each is trained. The predictions of classifiers are then combined by taking majority vote/ averaging the output.


10. Make quick notes on:

1. LOOCV.

2. F-measurement

3. The width of the silhouette

4. Receiver operating characteristic curve

1. LOOCV.

LOOCV(Leave One Out Cross-Validation) is a type of cross-validation approach in which each observation is considered as the validation set and the rest (N-1) observations are considered as the training set. In LOOCV, fitting of the model is done and predicting using one observation validation set.

2. F-measurement

The F-measure, also known as the F1 score, is a metric that is used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model. It is defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and is used to balance the precision and recall of a model in a single metric.

3. The width of the silhouette

Silhouette width is a widely used index for assessing the fit of individual objects in the classification, as well as the quality of clusters and the entire classification.

4. Receiver operating characteristic curve

The receiver operating characteristic curve is drawn with the x-axis as 1 - specificity (false positive) and the y-axis as sensitivity. sensitivity = a / (a + b), specificity = d / (c + d), false negative = b / (a + b), false positive = c / (c + d), and accuracy = (a + d) / (a + b + c + d).
